----------------------------
1. Pulled the last commit and reviewed.
2. Located all the pieces involved with the inventory.
3. Played around until i got more familiar.
4. I thought i had a plan but when i fired it up nothing happened. Nothing broke but nothing changed.
5. On Repl.cs : I tried using a double IF loop to set conditions for the CurrentOverlayState to trigger and print the Inventory text.
6. If that would have succeeded i would then advance to making it print CurrentOverlayState.Items
7. But try as i might i couldnt get it to work.
