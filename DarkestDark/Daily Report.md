Teusday 13/08/2020:
===================
1. Fucking finally.
	- Thank you for many patience.
	- Finally im back.
	- This is by far the most broken/annoying/messed apartment move i have ever had.
	- Been hounded by shananiganz and family every day all day until today.
	- But now i is back!

2. Evo:
	- I added a new function that just adds elemets into the Elements dictionary,
	- I did this in preparation to my next move:
		- Adding some basic user interactions:
			- Add Element Creature to GridWorld: Will be shown as a cell that contains ["o"], at designated position.
			- Move creature: Will change the location of the creature on the grid.
			- Kill creature: Will delete creature from grid.

	- Im not sure how to go at this:
		- Write a function that recives a complete grid string, 
				then places the creature in the designated inex of the grid string, 
					then return the updated grid string
						then print it again (with the PrintWorld function)
				 
		or

		- Edit the PrintWorld function so that it would also check the Elements dictionary for contents
				then print them along the GridWorld.
					Any changes to the contents of the grid will then have to be done by updating the Elements dictionary.

	- Plox gif input to ideas. 

Monday 10/08/2020:
==================
1. Moving apartments.
	- System going dark.
	- If all goes well system will be back online tomorrow evening.

Saturday 08/08/2020:
====================
1. Putting the house into boxes.

2. Automation course:
	- Almost done with 1/4 of the course.
	- Currently drilling arrays/lists/collections
		- Gonna have a few short quizes in this part of the course.
		- It aint much but its honest work.

3. Considering purchasing a Unity course on udemy.
	- Its a huge undertaking so it ill take a long time.
	- But i need to start at some point right?
	- Or would it be too much of a distraction?

Friday 07/08/2020:
==================
1. Spent whole day with family. Achievements unlocked! 
	- Due to possible mournful reasons i was indisposed until late night.
	- Hopefully the morrow will bring good news and i could focus on code.

06/08/2020:
===========
1. Testing Automation Course:
	- Reviewed the automation course test that i failed.
	- After attempting to reread the assignment i gave up and went for the test answers.
	- Like always, when you have the answers it looks so simple and clean.
	- But at least i tried to figure it out, so when i got the real answers i understand why they are good and why they work.
	- Fuckng tax calculator... What a bitch of a field :P
	- Next section of the course is about arrays and lists. GOOD! I need to get these things down! TOMORROW! MAYBE! EVENTUALLY!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!

2. Evo thingy:
	- 

05/08/2020:
===========
1. Had to round up a lot of errands today.
	- Did not get to code but i accomplished so many things off of my life checklist that im feeling really good.
	- Im moving apartments in 7 days time an there is a lot of shit to take care of. Code is still on my mind. I play ith it in my head.
	- But now im excited hen i think about sitting down to do it. YES! 

03/08/2020:
===========
1. Parameterization. Work on the contents of the cell.
get the elements dictionary to print its contents.

if you cant, go back to what you know and do that.

01/08/2020:
===========
1. A month of healing has passed. Now im back.

2. I started fiddling around. Writing some code that i feel comfortable in.

	- I started writing whatever and grdually improved on what i was making until i got stuck.
	- I went to stack overflow and got some help.
	- I managed to get over some simple problems.

	What i was trying to make:
		* A program that receives a list of strings = "[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]","[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]","[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]","[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]","[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]", "[ ]",

		* and prints a 5X5 grid as a string: "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]"
								 		     "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]"
								 		     "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]"
										     "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]"
										     "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]" "[ ]" 


	I couldnt get it to run at the end and iv spent my brain resources for the day.
	Ill fiddle around more tomorrow. Ill also speak with you when i still have juice so i can advance beyond mroe annoying problems.

Teusday 30/06/2020:
===================
1. Had some thougths about the hole design mentality. About not designing from UI and back. The comapny i orked for... All of their features were always made that way.
   I mean from a UI perspective. And it created a fucking madhouse in the database. Endless amount of tables that transform values so they could allow for communication
   between the different features, each with its individual data structure. The framework for that software was painfully clusterfucked and leaking from a million different pipes due to bottle necks, flooded logs, gaping errors, mismtached communications and desynched server activity.
   Yeah... bad practices make for bad code. Good thing i got to see this shit and. Better even that you put this in context for me. Thank you sensei.

2. Automation course:
	- Learned about optional and named parameters today. Nifty stuff.
	- Also the 'out' and 'ref' keywords. Functionality thickens. Desire to know more intensifies.
	- Tuples. The mini objects for when creating an entire object is overkill.
	- Did an exam: Write a tax calculator + tests.
		- I failed the exam.
		- I wrote a program that was too big and i couldnt get anything to work.
		- I reviewed the answers for the test and indeed i did not design accurately enough to the FRD.
		- The FRD was very vague and unhelpful but i guess thats intentional.
		- Ill retake the test again tomorrow.

3. DarkestDark:
	- Its Game Editor time:
		- I wrote the basic description for the editor methods.
		- Im not certain about a number of things.
		- QUESTIONS:
			- Yesterday you said i will need all of the contents of DarkestDark.Game. Can i link to it?
				or do i have to make duplicates in the seperated project?
			- I added a field called "Node ID". I thought i might need this in order to insert states into a specific location on the tree.
				Is this a good direction? Or do i need to instead provide a path to a spcific file + what line to insert the text data?
			- General review: Is this code more like what it should be?  

Monday 29/06/2020:
=================
1. Darkest Dark:
	- Wrote some rudimentary code.
	- I know that this code is painfully simple and repetitive.
	- But thats how my brain works so i started with that.
	- With practice i hope ill be able to write more advanced rudimentary stuff.
	

	WISDOM: if you write something that behaves like a state graph, use a state graph to describe it. try to avoid code that depends on user input. 

2. For tomorrow:
	- Make a class, give that class methods, each method describes an action that you want to make in the program.

Sunday 28/06/2020:
==================
1. Automation course:
	- did 5 more lessons + coding quiz.
		- Got the code down perfectly.
		- My test writing was off. I need more practice with that.

2. DarkestDark:
	- I want to write a function that: receives a string and then writes structured text to a json file.
		- Print prompt: "Would you like to make a new State or a new Transition?"
		- if (State)
			- Prompt: "Please name the new state"
				- Save user string input.
			-Prompt: "Please enter state text"
				- Save user string input.
			- Prompt: "How many transitions?"
				- Save user int input.
			- foreach (transition in transitions)
LABEL: TRANSITION- Prompt: "Please name transition"
					- Save user string input.
				- Prompt: "Please enter transition text"
					- Save user string input.
				- Prompt: "How many conditions?"
					- Save user int input.
				foreach (condition in conditions)
					- Prompt: "Please name condition"
						- Save user string input.
					- Prompt: "Please enter condition amount"
						- Save user int input.
					- Prompt: "How many items does this transition contain?"
						- Save user int input.
					- foreach(item in transition)
						- Prompt: "Please name item"
							- Save user string input.
						- Prompt: Is item an "inventory item" or a "journal entry"?  
							- Prompt: "Please enter item quantity" // if (Journal entry) quantity == 0
								- Save user int input.
						- Prompt: "Please enter item description"
								- Save user string input.
				- Prompt: "Please name target state"
					- Save user string input.
		
		- else (Transition)
			- Prompt: "To which State would you like to add this transition?"
				- Save user string input
				- Search for State in data
					- Save State path
				- GoTo TRANSITION.

		DATA GENERATION:
			- All that shit needs to be now be generated in a way that fits the data structure.

NEXT PHASE:
1. Design some GUI for the game. No getting around it. Needs to happen.

Before i start shredding code and putting all of this plan into action I would need to meditate on it and deepen my planning of specifics.
Also write proto code that will gradually be turned into real code.
I will start with making this code line by line. In places where im not sure about syntax i will write proto until helped by master. 

Saturday 27/06/2020:
====================
1. No study. Had to take the eekend off due to surprise circumstances.

Thursday 25/06/2020:
====================
1. Automation course:
	- Learned about while / do while / switch loops and stuff.
	- Had another small exam and a quiz.
	- Im doing pretty well. Still not 100% but when i get time to think and get to try some things, go over the test a few times, i manage to solve things mostly by myself.

2. Linux course:
	- Manual navigation and all sorts of commands.
	- Played around in my ubuntu.
	- Linux is fun and cute.
	- Im not scared... yet.

Wedesnday 24/06/2020:
=====================
1. Visited sensei for a lesson.
	- Gotta git gud at the basics and all problems will be easier to solve.

Watched: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-2P3MSZrBM
stopped currently at: 20:23
Thoughts: So classical mathematics was built on shaky grounds? In the sense that it relied on being able to calculate all problems to a finite number? 
		  However it did include anomalies such as pie? Hence it wasnt tight?
		  The turn point was when turing suggested that we view math instead as computations? where the final result is not the main focus? but just until its good enough
		  to ensure utility?

		  Thats what i got from it so far.

		  Also liked the part where he said that germany suffered intellectually from going fascist and getting rid of jews :P
		  Also Nitsche got dunked on. LEL BE ONTO THE NIHILSTS!!! XD

Teusday 23/06/2020:
===================
1. Automation course:
	- Did 4 lessons
	- Also did a quiz about nested loops and conditionals.
	- Kicked that quizes ass!
	- I have leveled up in the power of loops!

2. General education:
	- Yersterday as part of trying to differentiate the code that mster wrote i ended up google fooing some git related stuff
	- Also some vs related stuff
	- Eventually i managed to do everything i wanted to do.

3. Linux:
	- Got a sudden bone to pick ith linux. Gonna do some lessons about that.
	- So i did 3 lessons about the shell. Good to have some more understanding of this.

Monday 22/06/2020:
==================
1. Reviewed masters code update.
	- Iv tried to read it multiple times
	- Each time i try again it becomes slightly clearer
	- but i still dont know what im looking at
	- I mean i can tell its different from the previous version
	- But i dont understand what change was made in concept
	- I can sort of see that the code behaves the same aspreviously, but is more precise.
		- QUESTION: By idiomatic style do you mean that this form of the code is the more commonly expected style?
		- QUESTION: Is the cref thingy you did considered as documentation? im not familiar with the format and im not sure what these words mean.
			- How do i read this?
			- What is yield? From what i read it can be used in place of a foreach statement, but only in situations that fit into how it works specifically. wtf?
				- Can only be use with IEnumerable.
				- Will return 1 element from the IEnumerable at a time. Used with reference types
			- You changed the functions from lists into IEnumerables. Why?  

Saturday 20/06/2020:
=====================
1. WISDOM: 
	- When having trouble planning a function. Explain it to a human step by step and there you have it.
	- PIPELINE: A code that transfers outputs to inputs without looping the "Main" function. 
	- If you have a code that works, then make SURE its included in a commit. Then start a new branch where you
	  can fuck around.



Thursday: 18/06/2020:
=====================
1. Reviewing the code from the lesson.
	- Data represenatation:
		- Classes:
			- InputLine:
				- Has a list of strings called Names
				- Has a string called location
			- OutputLine:
				- Has a string called Name
				- Has a string called Location

		- Functions:
			- ReadInput:
				- A static list of InputLines that receives a string
				- Make an instance of an InputLine called result
				- Splits the received string according to "end line" & "new line" separators.
				- Saves the pieces of the string into an array of strings called lines.
					- Loop:
						- For each line in the array:
							- Split the line by '@' and '&' and save the strings into an array called parts
							- Collect the last word in the string and save it into a string called location
							- Save all the contents of parts array (except for the last one) into an enum of strings called names
							- Make an instance of an InputLine called item
							- Assign the value of names to the Names field of item. By data transformation from enum to string
							- Assign the value of location to the Location field of item
							- Add item into result
							- return result 
								- QUESTION: Is it really neccesary to have 2 distinct instances? Isnt it possible to transform the data directly into the result instance? Why the extra instance called item?

			- Massage: 
				- A static list of OutputLines that receives a list of InputLines
				- I think its supposed to turn these inputlines into strings
				- Then save them into a list of OutputLine instances.
				- Then return that list
					- Thats now what i was supposed to do.
					- I think i need to.. BAH!
					- Couldnt figure out how to assign that value of an InputLine field onto a OutputLine field. 

			- PrintOutput:
				- Receives the list of OutputLines from the Massage function. 
				- Formats the lines and saves them as strings
				- Prints the strings

	- HOMEWORK:
		- Tried some stuff.
		- Didnt call you because i had to leave for a family dinner.
		- Will try gaain tomorrow.


Wednesday 16/06/2020:
===================
1. HOMEORK:
	- Finish up the functions in Sandbox

	- WISDOM: Coding cannot be done while emotionally reved up. Chill or do not code.

Teusday 15/06/2020:
===================
1. Trying to get myself to do anything.
	- My therapist said some shit today that fucked with my head.
	- Need to study.
	- I give up for tonight.
	- Some days are just not my days.

Monday 14/06/2020:
==================
1. Madness is an ilness. No study.

Saturday 13/06/2020:
1. No study today. Things got in the way.

Friday 12/06/2020:
==================
1. Darkest Dark:
	- Compiler:
		- Reviewed previous info + code.
		- Attempting to write better code now.
		- My attempts were unsuccessful.
		- I somehow couldnt figure out how to apply the Split()
		  In a way that gets me what i want.
		- I am done for the day.
		- Will try other things tomorrow.

Thursday 11/06/2020:
====================
1. No study today. Personal reasons.

Wenesday 10/06/2020:
====================
1. Lesson:
	- Build a parser that receives: Moshe @ Israel
									Boris & Marisa @ Russia
									Halil & Lara & Ford @ Egypt

	And returns:
				- Halil is in Egypt
				- Boris is in Russia
				- Lara is in Egypt
				- Moshe is in Israel
				- Marisa is in Russia
				- Ford is in Egypt

	Protocode:
				{
					Parser(string text)
					{
						foreach (Char in text)
							// seperate the string into single characters and save them in an internal list
							// How do i do the seperation part?
							{
								foreach(Char in list)
								// Check database for a Match()
								// I suppose give it a file path and tell it to read it.
								// I believe that Match() is an existing function. Does it belong to a specific class?
								// Can it only work with specific data types?
									if (Match == true)
									{
										return the matching item
									}
									else
									{
										return "ERROR PROMPT"
									}
							}
					}
				}
				CONCLUSION: Check sandbox prject for some gud stuff called Split().

	QUESTIONS:
			1. I find it hard to focus on more than 1 project. Is there a perspective change that could make project transition easier?
				- Git Gud Noob
				- Maybe make simple project log. To help coming back up to speed.
				- "Good Code" -> Makes it easier to get back into a project. 
				- "Good Code" == Whatever code is easier to get back into.

			2. I am running away from writing code. I cope by building energy stacks during the day and then eventually sit myself down.
				- Is there advice for turning this behavior into a more streamlined chill work on product?  

			3. May i harass master while working on code as if we were sitting in the office and i just nag with small questions?
				- Yes. But masters availability may differ.

			4. What is your opinion / stand on neurolink?
				- I should eucate myself about it more before reaching any conclusion.
				- But it seems that i will have to get one if i want to stay competitive.


Teusday 09/06/2020:
===================
1. Darkest Dark:
	- Start fidgeting around and try to make a parser.
		- Figure out the tokens that will be required in order to represent the game data.
		- The eventual product will:
			- receive an input.
			- Parse the input and recognize tokens.
			- Create matching tokens.
			- Hand them to a Jsoncoverter.
			- Save the new data members.

	- Tokens required:
		- Letter token
		- Number token
		- Whitespace token
		- EndOfFile token
		- Bad token
		- Quotation token
		- Coma token
		- Colon token
		- OpenCurly token
		- CloseCurly token
		- OpenSquare token
		- CloseSquare token
		- At token
		- Plus token
		- Minus token

	- Now i need to make a lexer.
		- If i understand correctly a lexer takes input and returns tokens. Ill go review the code.
			- Looks like ill 1st have to define a token class.
			- I might make use if inheritance. But thats for later.
			- Ill start by setting some things up for the parser.

	- Ok i got stuck.
		- Iv been reading the lexer code as well as the parser code over and over.
		- There seems to be a lot going on and im not sure that im reading all of it correctly.
		- Also there seem to be a lot of different ways for dealing with unusual inputs.
		- While im sure that these are required for proper compiler writing, I dont think i need all of those just to start.
		- Having a hard time sorting out the necessary code from the superflous stuff.
		- Im done for the day but i like where this is going. Ill try and get some more work done tomorrow before our session
		- But i do need to go to work for most of the day. So it will be tight.

Monday 08/06/2020:
==================
1. Darkest Dark:
	- Compiler:
		- Added more code.
		- Im halfway through this video.
		- Im stopping progress to review wtf i have been writing.
		 

Sunday 07/06/2020:
==================
1. Darkest Dark:
	- Compiler: 
		- I added more code.
		- This is getting ridiculus.
		- And the dude who writes the code claims that this is considered a rudementary and poorly written compiler.
		- Fuck this. I cant. Ill need you to walk me through this.

Saturday 06/06/2020:
====================
1. Darkest Dark
	- Compiler:
		- So i followed a compiler writing tutorial.
		- None of the code i wrote is my code.
		- Im just doing my best to keep up and understand what im writing.
		- FYI i am beyond certain that writing a compiler is way out of my skill level.
		- Feel like im being power leveled.
		- Still barely have an idea what is going on.... Somethign about tokenizations and characters and stuff.
		
		- QUESITON: WTF is a lexer? 

		- There is more to this program but im freaking out so im done for now. 

Friday 05/06/2020:
==================
1. No study today. I escape from code by being mentol to younger brother who asked for great wisdom.

Thursday 04/05/2020:
====================
1. Automation course:
	- Did 8 lesson today.
	- Including a code excersize and 2 quizes.
	- Aced that motherufucker.
	- Tomorrow i will take the "Midterm Exam".
	- Looks like the course is done with "exposition" and from now on were going to move much faster.
	 
	- Looked at some examples for questions im likely to have to answer during a QA Automation job interview.
		- I was glad that about 50% of them were simple stuff for me.
		- 25% were stuff im not sure about but i think i can do by simple learning.
		- 25% were beyond my current capacity
			- Examples (for stuff i dont know):
				- Write a program to find the depth of a binary search tree, without using recursion.
				- Find out the occurrence of a given word in a given array. The word may occur left to right, up to down and vice versa.
				- You are given a large amount of log files, how would you find the top 10 visited links?
				

2. HOMEWORK:
	- Watched a short lecture about how to write a markdown parser. 
	- They spoke about "pipes & filters" also known as a "pipeline":
		- A row of renderers that feed each other and eventually produce a finished expression. 
		- Do this by making a seperate renderer that handles each requirement that you have.
		- Then arrange them by a logical order that gives the requested result.
	- This did not simplify ANYTHING!
	- Trying another video
	- Found a 1:40 hour long lesson called "Lets build a compiler". Ill and get through as much as i can today but im already spent.
		- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHIkdUQbp0&list=PLRAdsfhKI4OWNOSfS7EUu5GRAVmze1t2y
		- This seems to be an entire 50 hour course broken into sections about how to write a compiler from scratch.
		- Ill try and seep whatever info that i need from it and leave the rest of it for when ill need to advance.
		- Holy shit. This starts off with a blast of jargon. But dude said that he is just demostrating the finished product.
		- And later he will do a step by step style teaching. Im done for tonight.

Wednesday 03/05/2020:
=====================
1. Lesson:
	- QUESTION: (Regarding classes with multiple constructors) How frequent are massive single classes that have a great variation of constructors? What is your opinion on such Code practices?

	- ANSWER: Depends on the specifics or requirements as well as personal preference. 

	- QUESTION: Value / Reference types. Changing their values does / not change the stored value? When i change a value type value is a new memory block created with the new value? And when i do this with a reference type, it does change the stored value instead of making a new one?
	- ANSWER: 
		- Stack and heap both deal only with RAM
		- A refference type is a value type whos value is an address.
		- * can be used to address a specific member in memory.
		- => can do so as well.
		- Not arranging these values correctly will result in slower programs.
		- To learn how to do this right, wait until you get to a point where this issue ill rise, then you will learn it properly.
		- This is almost never of early concern in any feature design.
		- Learn more languages and these concepts will become more self evidence.
		- C# is a usability oriented language.
			- Its main use is for writing fast and efficiently.
			- To acheive maximum memory structoral efficiency do not use C#. 
				- Thats because it goes through a virtual compiler before being received by the machine. 
			- Learn about language speeds at:
				https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/csharp.html
				- Some languages exceed others on different parameters.
				- The same languages can also be poor selection for tackling a specific problem in a program.

	- QUESTION: Is it standard practice to write tests for classes? Or for any code written? Is it part of the regular day to day work? 

	- ANSWER: Depends 100 percent on the quality control of the specific employer.
			  You can do so at your own volition / discretion.
			  Its good practice in general but there are no absolute rules about this.
			  All in all it is a tool for debugging that can be used if seen as necessary by the developer.

	- QUESTION: Did not understand "get / set" accessors part of class writing. btw what defines an accesor?

	- ANSWER: An odd feature. 
				- The "get" and "set" functions of a property will get called depending on:
					- Is the value being read.
					- Is the value being assigned.
				- MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW LINE BY LINE WHEN USING GET & SET.
				- Also shorthand to writing methods.
				- Some consider it more aesthetic 
				- Btw, dont use floats until you understand much more stuff.
				- Data transformation and verification. This is a field in itself.
				- Automatic property: public int Name { get; set; }
					


	- QUESTION: assert method 3rd argument is called "Tolerance". want some info about it.

	- ANSWER: When attempting to assert the value of a number, you can allow for a tolerance ratio for the assertion. 
				- Strings do not use assert(). Instead you can use "fuzzySearch" or other such methods.
				- Learn about the "hamming distance". This is very commonly used in autocorrect programs as well as search engines. 

	- I want to try and create a "create user" interface that will be accessible from the Main Menu.
		- Just for start it should contain:
			- User Name
			- Number of playthroughs on that user
		- QUESTION: Will this require me to create a json file that holds the instances of new users?
					Or will that info be saved into an array or an IEnumerable?
		
		- ANSWER: For long term savings of values from every run of the program there must be a file that receives values from the program.
					- You can use JsonConvert.SerializeObject() in orer to turn an object into json text.
					- Serialization == Turning a data structure into a "line".
					- Objects are never saved into the hard drive unless implicitly applied.
					- File() can do this.
					- Working directly with the hard disk is considered risky since this makes for vulnerable programs with high likelyhood   for fatal errors.
					- Make note of getting better at this field.

	- QUESTION: Is there a point in trying to write this feature with my current knowledge or should i stuy more before attempting?
		- code and learn as you go.
		- You cant just study or just write. 
		- Do both!

	- Question: Did i get too involved with the compiler? Was i supposed to just take what i need and leave? When does curiosity defeat the 
				original requirement?

	- ASNWER: Its complicated:
				- A way to codify code lines so that they ill take less lines is called "Regex" (Regular Expressions).
				- A popular way of locking down code that works and will now no longer be accessible or even readable by novice
				  developers.
				- Its recommended to avoid using Regex before some serious wizardry capacity is acheived.
				- When dealing with Regex. Learn about it when required but dont go crazy over it if its took complex.
				- Simple Regex can be good for learning. start from simple stuff and work your way up.

2. HOMEWORK:
	- I started too advanced in the compiler learning.
	- Go watch a "Parser 101" tutorials.
	- This field is considered one of the most important fields for automation focused developing.

	WISDOM: While learning try to ballance learning about code and writing actual code. do this by alternating between the two frequently.
			Get better at discerning at which point the alternation should occur.
			For me specifically i should put more of an emphasys on actual code writing over theory learning.

Teusday 02/05/2020:
===================
1. Automation course:
	- Today I learned that i can make as many different constructors on the same class.
	- Also learned how to use those. The possibilities are limitless.
	- QUESTION: How frequently are massive single classes that have a great variation of constructors? What is your opinion on such
			    Code practices?


2. Darkest Dark:
	- Still learning about the parser.
	- Lecture dude says that a series of parsers is OP
	- Suggests looking into how primitive data types are described and processed to gain insight into parsers.

	- This stuff is reallt hard for me to follow.
	- Im literally following this lecture 1 minute at a time on repeat just so i could keep on following.
	- Maybe its a bit too much?
	- Link to lecture:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klHyc9HQnNQ
	- Read some comments about the lecture. People telling the lecturer that his lambda is lacking.

Monday 01/06/2020:
==================
1. Darkest Dark:
	- Still learning about the parser for the compiler. This stuff is heavy. Every slide shown contains so much that i see for the 1st time and need to internalize and then understand just so that i could follow the next slide.
	- This lecture is clearly aimed at veteran developers.
	- I find it difficult to follow but im happy that i can. 

Sunday 31/05/2020:
==================
1. Automation course:
	- Learned about the String class and about classes and constructors in general. Good to get  better feel for them.
	- Boxes with rules in boxes with rules.

	- QUESTION: Value / Reference types. Changing their values does / not change the stored value? When i change a value type value is a new memory block created ith the new value? And hen i do this with reference type it does change the stored value instead of making a new one?

2. Darkest Dark:
	- HOLY CRAP! I just remembered that i was supposed to be learning about how to write a compiler.
	- Ill review my own notes.

Saturday 30/05/2020:
====================
1. Automation course:
	- 1st task that requires a few dozen code lines.
		- Defining and instanciating a class with various fields, properties, methods etc.
		- Its not hard to understand, Its just a lot of work. I mean... compared to hat iv been doing until now.
		- I get the feeling that i get very tired after very little code. I hope i will be able to keep up when the tasks become more sizeable 
		- I finished the task from the course. My brain has been used to its final extent. I only made 2 small mistakes in my entire 150
		  code lines written for this task. I feel proud and accomplished. But also exhausted. 

		- QUESTION: Is it standard practice to write tests for classes? Or for any code written? Is it part of the regular day to day work? 

	- Only did 1 lesson today since it took me a few hours to get through the task.

2. Darkest Dark:
	- Started reviewing tutorials about how to write a "create user" feature.
		- Stack overflow says:
			- Need to add an external database to store the data input.
			- The database will rely on a table containing the relevant fields.
			- There are various suggestions about which database to set up. I havent a clue which to choose.
			- Link database to the app.
				- Import OLEdb library.
				- Code buttons that add new profiles
				- Create a connection string
				- Write code that handles sorting the input into the database.

	- QUESTION: Is there a point in trying to write this feature with my current knoledge or should i stuy more before attempting?

Friday 29/05/2020:
=================
1. Automation course:
	- Groked 10 lessons today.
	- Did some code practices revolving around writing some tests that run int variables through a formula and printing the results
	- Specifically checking if a year is a leap year.
	- couldnt finish one of the exercises. The one about adding all the numbers in an array and returning the result.
	- Dont know if its because the logic i wrote has an issue or if im thwarted by syntax. 

	- Now the course is teaching me about classes and objects. This should be good.
	- QUESTION: Did not understand "get / set" accessors part of class writing.

2. Darkest Dark:
	- I want to try and create a "create user" interface that will be accessible from the Main Menu.
		- Just for start it should contain:
			- User Name
			- Number of playthroughs on that user
		- QUESTION: Will this require me to create a json file that holds the instances of new users?
					Or will that info be saved into an array or an IEnumerable?
Thursday 28/05/2020:
====================
1. Automation course:
	- QUESTION: assert method 3rd argument is called "Tolerance". want some info about it.

	- Groked 3 lessons today + review of stuff from yesterday + from last week.
	- Logical operators practice in test execution. Groovy.
	- Reviewed some material for Darkest Dark. 
		- Started planning out some ideas. i will upload some code during the weekend.] 

Wednesday 27/05/2020:
=====================
1. Lesson:
	- 

Teusday 26/05/2020:
===================
1. Automation course:
	- Im getting more insight to why testing is considered a simple entry point to programming.
	- It does require basic coding understanding and skills, but its possible to get by with just the basics.
	- The whole testing interface is so much more noob friendly than just dealing with raw code.

	- QUESTION: The modulus. What is it exactly? The course says that its used in order to keep the remainder when using division on ints.
				I get the feeling that there is much more to it then that.

	- QUESITON: About decimal data type as opposed to floats and doubles, in consideration of computation time.
				CONTEXT: When programs run slow, is it because of poor data type choices? What other examples of things that make for slow code?

Monday 26/05/2020:
==================
1. Automation course:
	- Intro to tetsing with numbers. So far only simple stuff.

Sunbday 24/05/2020:
===================
1. Automation course:	
		- Learned about class initialization and cleanup.
		- Had a quiz in the course and got a perfect score! :D
		- Like all quizes though, its easy when you know the answers.
		- Thankfully i have been actually paying attention! And taking notes! :D 
		- Next lesson its getting into maths.. With exercises.. Wish me luck. 

Saturday 23/05/2020:
====================
1. Automation course:
		- Homework:
			- Wrote some tests as requested by the course.
			- Test formatting. Yay. A new headache.

		- Lessons:
			- Played a bit with the different Assert methods
			- Test initialization is good. Have a place to keep all the stuff and avoid duplication.
			- Started learning about test cleanup as well.

2. General code:
		- Watched a crash course about OOP methodology.
		- Two methodologies were discussed:
			- Coad & Yowdon
				Object Oriented Analysis
				Object Oriented Design
				Object Oriented Modeling Technique
				Object Oriented Software Engineering

				Identification of classes
				Investigate app domain & system environment

				Identification of structures
				Is a relationship

				Definition of subject, attributes & methods

			
			- Booch
				Micro improvement
				Identify the classes
				Identify the semantics of class & object
				Identify the relationship of classes & objects
				Start implementation

				Macro improvement
				Basic needs of software (conceptualization)
				Analysis
				Design
				Development phase
				Maintenance

				Question: Are developers required to deal with such concepts when working daily?
						  Or is such concepts the private domain of architects?


Friday 22/05/2020:
==================
1. No study. Am needed rest.

Thursay 21/05/2020:
===================
1. Went reading about the origins of OOP.
	- Couldn't find the version of it that you mentioned.
	- Seems to have always been a developing concept.
	- You said that during the 70's they had it the best?
	- I understand the importance of classes and inheritance being a thing.
	- Plus garbage collection as well as encapsulation and such concepts.

		- Question: What changed about the methodology since the 70's that you think should have stayed?

			- My assumption: The wild nature of the sprint model makes it more difficult to polish out core related issues.
							 This results in clunkey / buggy programs that one day become too much trouble for their worth.

2. Automation course:
	- Next to every code test in VS there is a tiny little icon. That icon represents the results of the test (positive / negative)
	- Right click the code lines of a test and select "Run this test". The icon then will mark the result of the test.
	- Clicking the icon will open up more info on the test results.

	- Assertions are a testing playground.
	- I should get better at learning existing tools and stop trying to invent stuff that has already been made very well.
	- GIT GUD AT FINDING MORE WISDOM!

	- [ExpectedException]:
		- Is almost never used in functional test automation.
		- It is however very common in unit testing, when you expect some method to throw an exception.
		- This wont be used in this course but it is an important tool to have in general.

3. Course homework:
	- Write some tests to get a feel for testing.
	- Will do this tomorrow.

4. DarkestDark:
	- Added a new issue to the Git with more ideas for the game.
	- Just because iv shifted my focus does not mean im not involved ith the game.
	- YEAH BOI!

	- Compiler code that i stole from an online lecture, this code is supposed to be the be all end all of Parsers:

		Static Result<int> Natural(Input input)
		{
			Var next = input.NextChar();
			If (!next.HasValue | | !char.IsDigit(next.Value))
				Return Result.Empty<int>(input);

		Input remainder;
		Var val = 0;
		Do
		{
			Val = 10 * val +
				CharUnicodeInfo.GetDigitValue(next.Value);
			Remainder = next.Remainder;
			Next = remainder.NextChar();
		}	
		while (next.HasValue && char.IsDigit(next.Value))
		Return Result.Value(val, remainder);
		}

	- QUESTION: I have no point of reference, is this parser the shit?
	- Well the lecturer now said that this code is anal and not entirely necessary. But i would like your opinion on the code all the same.
	- REQUEST: I would like to receive an in depth lesson from you about the matter. If you consider me ready of course. 
	


Wednesday 20/05/2020:
=====================
1. Automation course.
	- Learned a lot today:
		- String.Format() is very badass. A needed building block for console apps.
		- Assert() seems to be a very useful tool for testing.
		- The Test Explorer. Comfy and swift. Now i know why the tests i wrote looked so odd to you.

	- Question: Since reference type variables are also called "objects". Does object oriented programming focuses on reference type structure?
	- Question: Is the String.Format() function a parser? 
	- Question: What else is required other than a parser to make a compiler.
			- Compiler:
				- Tokenization: 
					- Scanning
					- Evaluating

				- Syntax analysis (Parsing):
					- Transform a sequence of tokens into a parsed tree.
					- This is defined by the formal grammar of the language. 
				
				- Semantic analysis:
					- Builds the symbol table
					- Performs:
						- Type checking
						- Issue warnings
						- requires a complete parse tree

				- Code generation:
					- The result of the previous phase is translated into code.

		

	- Question: Is MsTest framework actually the industry standard for running tests on microsoft based languages?
		- Not the right question!
		- All testing frameworks are simillar.
		- Know one well and you can adapt.

2. Lesson:
	- Database:
		- Is a matrix of cells?
		- Memory is treated like a line with numbers marked on it.
		- There are designated sections for things that always exist in every program.
			- Stack (in programming): Last in 1st out.
				- Very fast.
				- Close to the CPU for speed bonus.
				- Good for small pieces of data.
				- Few pieces.

			- Heap (in programming): "Available memory".
				- Slower.
				- Is only limited by memory size.
				- Make sure to set it up correctly to avoid memory leaks / CPU death. 

	- Definition overloading: When a single word could mean multiple things.
		- Some words are more overloaded than others.
		- Before jumping to conclusions make sure to cross reference definitions.
		- OG object oriented methodology. Look it up.

HOMEWORK:
	- Think about how to protoype a compiler for lambda expressions.
	- Think about chruch numerals
	- Beta reductions automator.
	- Etc 

Monday - Teusday 18 - 19/05/2020:
================================
1. Days of heavy feels. But after much heals i believe tomorrow should be a new day.

Sunday 17/05/2020:
==================
1. I didnt study today. I have no excuses. Im ok i think. Ill ask my therapist about it tomorrow.

Saturday 16/05/2020:
====================
1. So today i have made the descision that i shall now crunch testing automation.
	- This will continue until i finish the course / find a job.
	- I still want to keep on working on Darkest Dark though.
	- I will start thinking about how i could write some tests for the game so i could practice and learn while im at it.

2. Automation course
	- We are now at variables.
	- Now that i not as threatened, im actually taking a lot more in. I completely missed out on reference types when you taught me.
	- I remember that they exist i just did not internalize that they are variables as well.

Friday 15/05/2020:
==================
1. DarkestDark:
	- Opened a new git issue and solved it. Just some fixes in the data.
	- Commented out the problematic code that was preventing compilation.

2. Compiler:
	- Started watching a master class about compilers.
	- Mostly focused on "Parsers".
	- Ah i see.... SQL is fucking broken ass bullshit.
	- Why use SQL when you can write a language that serves specific project better?
	- What better way to query data than to codify a slave that works in the data base and knows only of what i design it to do for me.
	- Namely evaluating expressions.
	- WIZARDRY ITENSIFIES!
	- Am i in the right direction?

3. About my question... WHAT SHOULD I FOCUS ON? Programming or Getting job in QA Automation? PLOX GIF WISDOM!
	

Thursday 14/05/2020:
====================
0. Uploading the stuff from yesterday.

1. Finished watching the crash course on WPF.

2. Did a few more lessons about test automation. Still going through basics.

3. Question: Yesterday kinda ended in a question mark for me. What should i focus on now?
	- My wish is to focus on programming so that the day in which i work as a programmer will come sooner.
	- But realistically i should focus on testing automation so i could get a job.
	- I would like to hear your honest advice.



Wednesday 13/05/2020:
--------------------
1. Darkestark mini data test:
	- Added some broken code skeleton for the test prototype.
	- I couldn't get it to work. But i also kept on reworking it because i wasn't sure how to do it.
	- BAH! Not enough time to work this out.

2. Lesson:
	- STOP DELETING CODE ATTEMPTS!
	- MAKE A COMMIT FOR EACH BROKEN CODE THAT DIDNT WORK.
	- TRY SOMETHING ELSE AND COMMIT IT AS WELL IF IT DOESNT WORK.


Teusday 12/05/2020:
-------------------
1. Reviewed masters fix.
		- Indeed the reason for the inventory printing was the spillover from the testing we fooled around with on the mini.
		- Was not surprised that the anser was simple. "Comment out the code that ran the test".
		- Thank you for making my fix on staterunner nicer to read. I was sure that i wrote it in an ugly fashion.
		- Also i bet there are other ways to write it. But this is good enough for now.

2. Compiler:
		- Made an excel chart representation of the data.
		- Added Mini Data Rep.xlsx file.
		- I understand that i was not supposed to make a direct replica of the current rep.
		- But i couldn't think of a new format that improves on the one master made.
		- I figured that ill start from having a replica and then start working from there.

3. Testing program for mini:
		- Wrote a pseudo code description of what i came up with.
		- Added file: Testing Prototyping.md
		- I think it should look something like this.
		- BRAIN FART:
			- Would it be frugal to write a program that:
				- Has a GUI with buttons that run tests.
				- Each button triggers its correlating function.
				- Add an SQL port for performing manual tests on the data.
				- This i think is standard in server management platforms. Yes?

4. Learning UI:
	- Watched half of an hour long crash course tutorial for WPF.
	- I get it. Its rather simple.
	- Its the tricks and wisdom that will require experience in order to implement.
	- Im starting to gain an understanding of why you hate UI so much :)

Monday 11/05/2020:
------------------
1. Darkest Dark
	- Fixed the inventory issue where item at value < 0 are printed.
	- For some reason the inventory is printed now even when not opened manually.
	- I tried to do some debugging but i wanna die right now so i gave up rather quick.
	- I hate being like this

Saturday + Sunday == Depression

Friday 09/05/2020:
------------------
HOMEWORK:

1. Started educating myself about UI.
	- FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
	- Well... i knew it was going to be a huge subject.
	- Lucky for me i learned a lot of the basics for visual design in photography course at film school.
	- But i was more of a script writer than a photographer.
	- So a lot of new technical and very valuable info coming in in torrents.
	- Im a bit overwhelmed.
	- Right i was supposed to focus on infrastructure. Jesus... right!
	- Holy bleeding hell... THAT DID NOT NARROW IT DOWN AT ALL!!!! AAHHH!!!
	- Well... of course... Its just so much. Easy...Easy...

2. WPF looks cool as hell.
	- Should i learn XAML?
	- I think i will have to learn XAML
	- Omg grids.....
	- Iv had enough of this for now.
	- Next thing!
	- Lel next thing is XAML.
	- NEXT!

3. Well... I downloaded DDLC and it was free from some website.
	- Is it supposed to be free?
	- I hope i didnt donwload a virus.
	- Didnt install it yet.
	- Paranoia kicks in.
	- Ill wait until you help me verify my safety of this... thing i downloaded.
	- The game trailer says it is free. But why is it not on some platform?
	- Its just distributed through a url?
	- https://ddlc.moe/
	- Is this the real deal?  


Thursday 07/05/2020:
--------------------
1. Had a job opportunity today. Only got home at 22:00. No code today, had to make money loading and unloading cargo. Its a living. For now...

Wednesday 06/05/2020:
----------------------------
1. Darkest Dark:
[Resolved] - "Make nitroglycerine" transition should no longer be available after being used.
[Resolved] - "Search the writing desk" transition should no longer be available after being used.
[Resolved] - "Little lockbox" transition should no longer be available after being used.
[Resolved] - "Maybe the imps know something about the headless course" is unavailable for some reason. check conditions.
[Resolved] - "Statue Room1" state does not show "Present roberts head" transition even when conditions are met. check conditions.
[Resolved] - "Examine upside down cross" transition Should no longer be available after being used. Also it should print the correct text.
[Resolved] - "Perhaps the imps know something about the headless course" Should no longer be available after being used.

Yet to resolve.  Or where i got stuck:
- Revisited rooms still give the initial scene. Causing scenes to occur an infinite amount of times.
		- Need to find those and correct them individually.
- During gargoyle fight: Its possible to know the names of the rooms even if you havent visited them yet.
		- Can be resolved by adding "Door1, Door2" etc to the gargoyle fight and making special transitions for them.
- Inventory: You can have negative items that get printed. if their value is lower than 0.
		- Can be resolved by making sure that the inventory does not print ANYTHING with value lower than 1. 
- Any endgame ends in a crash. Make a title screen that doesnt make the console screen jump away.
		- This is of lesser importance.


Lesson:

- Think about writing a program that checks the data for errors:
		- Checks that all targetstates have corresponding states.
		- Checks that all transitions that belong to states exist.

HOMEWORK:
- Compiler:
		- Try and write an excel file that represents the mini data.
		- ADVICE: Focus on things that have been written more than once and try to "automate" them
		- Try coming up 

- Play around with Winforms. Bonus points if you manage to integrate mini data into it.

- Play DDLC!!!!!! DONT READ ABOUT IT JUST PLAY.

- UI:
	- Start educating self in UI field of study.
	- We wont deal with "UX" (User Experience).
	- We will focus on infrastructure.

Examples of UI:
- WinForms
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundations) < - Will replace WinForms one day
- XAML (Part of WPF) < - Markup Language

Unity (Game Engine) UI:
- Works with C#
- Requires extensive experience with Unity
- Unity is very buggy

Unreal (Game Engine)
- Works with C++ 
- Node based programming
- As devilish as Cubase

Goddot (Game Engine)
- Can install C# plugin
- Editor is limited.
- Is about as grand as photoshop

Web UI:
- works mainly with Html + css.
- Blazor.
- JAVA SCRIPT Recommended.

Teusday 05/05/2020:
------------------------
1. It was my anniversary with yaarit. Chose to focus myself on that.

Monday 04/05/2020:
------------------------
1.  Darkest Dark: Bug log:
[Resolved] - Cross is available during fights even after it is destroyed. Check conditions.
[Resolved] - "Examine table" transition should no longer be available after being used.
[Resolved] - "Hidden door" transition should no longer be available after being used.
- "Move clock hands to 3:15" transition should no longer be available after being used.
- "Make nitroglycerine" transition should no longer be available after being used.
- "Search the writing desk" transition should no longer be available after being used.
- "Little lockbox" transition should no longer be available after being used.
- "Statue Room1" state does not show "Present roberts head" transition even when conditions are met. check conditions.

- Inventory: You can have negative items that get printed. if their value is lower than 0.
- Any endgame ends in a crash. Make a title screen that doesnt make the console screen jump away.



Sunday 03/05/2020:
1.1 DarkestDark:
		- Started fixing some issues. Just making sure that what we have is at least set up correctly.
					- QUESTION:  Is there a free task management  software you would recommend? I feel the need to start having some sort of organized bug log.

1.2 Bug Log:
		Darkest Dark:
								 - Revisited rooms still give the initial scene. Causing scenes to occur an infinite amount of times.
								 - "Maybe the imps know something about the headless course" is unavailable for some reason. check conditions.
								 - Cross is available during fights even after it is destroyed. Check conditions.
				[Resolved] - Imp fight has a number of messed up target names. Fix those to the correct ones.
				[Resolved] - Clock hands can be moved without finding the clock scribble 1st.
				[Resolved] - no need for nitro in order to use nitro in gargoyle fight
				[Resolved] - Mistress conversation1: No conditions for speaking about different things. Also the endings arent wired correctly.
				[Resolved] - Mistress melting leads to a dead end. GBB!!!! GBB!!!
				[Resolved] - "End her" transition crashes game.
							 	 - During gargoyle fight: Its possible to know the names of the rooms even if you havent visited them yet.
								 - Inventory: You can have negative items that get printed. if their value is lower than 0.
							   	 - "I shall be your groom" transition crashes game.
				[Resolved] - Its possible to throw nitro at mistress when you dont have nitro. check for more item conditions in mistress fight.
				[Resolved] - Throwing nitro at mistress breaks the game.
								 - Any endgame ends in a crash. Make a title screen that doesnt make the console screen jump away.


2. Mini data:
		Bug log:
				[Resolved] - Speaking with person when you have nothing to speak of still leads to regular person screen.
								 - "To Room" transition name is always printed. It should be hidden. Dont know if this is important or just annoying.
				[Resolved] - Its possible to speak about antimatter before you know its name
								 - After speak with person there are no more options. THIS ONE BROKE ME. Couldnt fix it.
								 - After you speak about antimatter there are no more options.
								 
								 
3. Testing automation course:
		- Another lesson. This one was about VS shortcuts and stuff.
		
		
Saturday 02/05/2020:
------------------------
1. Mini data:
		- Kept setting up the data. Got bug i couldnt fix:
				- "Speak with person" mini transition becomes unavailable after its visited once. Even though i think i wired it so that visiting "Look around room" to make it available again.
					I tried different stuff but i couldn't get it to become available again. One option is to have it not give itself as an item hence never being unavailable.
				- Ok so i solved it by removing some of the conditions.
				
		- Other bugs:
				- Ok iv encountered all sorts of unexpected behaviors. I have managed to resolve most of them by correcting the data setup.
				- But now my mind is weary of this project. Shifting to DarkestDark.
				
				
2. DarkestDark:
		- Encountere many small bugs. Decided to log them first and then choose which ones to tackle:
				- Revisited rooms still give the initial scene. Causing scenes to occur an infinite amount of times.
				- Clock hands can be moved without finding the the clock scribble 1st.
				- Destroying the imps leads back to a conversation with them. Check all imps fight transitions.
				- "Maybe the imps know something about the headless course" is unavailable for some reason. check conditions.
				- Cross is available during fights even after it is destroyed. Check conditions.
				- There were a few more but i fixed them with little effort. Most of these look like they would be more or less easy.
				- Its just work. Ill get to it.
				
				
3. Testing automation course:
		- Debugging basics:
				- It was nice, having a step by step introduction to stuff that you tought me long ago and i didnt write down properly.
				- Again your teachings are incredibly on point. Thank you sensei.

Friday 01/05/2020:
---------------------
1. Due to unexpected circustances i have not had the time to make a proper.
		- It however was on my mind throughout the day.
		- Iv got plans... or mroe correctly... Thoughts of plans. I think...

Thursday 30/04/2020:
-------------------------
1. More data:
		- Added some journal entries and placed them around the ending scene.

2. Mini data:
		- Started translating the mini rep into actual data.
		- Its still giving me a headache. 
		- I must be patient. There is much to do and much to learn.
		- Did not yet implement transitions having themselves as a condition.

3. Automation course:
		- Did 9 more lessons

Wednesday 29/04/2020:
----------------------------
1. Added some more journal entries + items + conditions to the imp scene in level 3

2. Testing automation course:
		- Finished another 11 lessons.
		- Those were a tutorial about VS and good coding practices / conventions.
		- They pretty much said all of the stuff you have been driling into my head.
		- So far so good. I really hope that now when im a level 3 wizard i will be able to blow through hmost of this course with ease.

3. Lesson:
			- New functions:
					- Any == OR
					- All == AND
			
			- Transition.cs:
					- Now transitions can have multiple conditions.
					
HOMEWORK:
			- Still building data compiler.
			- Continue working on mini data:
						- Rundown - Complete
						- Mini data - in progress: Currently apply that each transition has its own items as default conditions for itself.
																This way transitions that have been used will no longer show.
						- Minimal rep - Currently using the format sensei made.
						
Teusday 28/04/2020:
------------------------
1. HOMEWORK:
		- Added a new md file that contains the rundown of how the game should behave.
		- Please give feedback if again i misunderstood the drill
		- Or maybe just didnt do good enough job.
		
2.  Data:
		- Added some items and conditions to the imps encountered
		
3. Testing automation course:
		- Reached lesson 11 out of 71/
		- Last few lessons were about google foo, debugging practices and ballancing ego / learning / frustration and asking for help. 

HOMEWORK: Write the playthrough of mini test run.
-----------
FORMAT: 
-----------
You see a man.
1. Ask about X

> 1
----
The man says x is 1
You see the same man.
1. Ask about X
2. Ask About Y


Monday 27/04/2020:
------------------------
1. Homework:
		- Have expanded on the mini data in order to closer replicate the problem
		- Have written a bit about the problem and its complexity.
		- Made a new md file for that.
		
2. I have an idea for  a new feature -> I want to make a function that unlocks special journal entries. Like an "achievement unlocked" kinda thing. 
		- Those special entries will be the ones deciding the avilable endings.
		- This will simplify the end game wiring substancially. I think...

Please review my ideas give me feedback.

3. I have added some conditions to the temple room transitions.

4. Testing Automation course:
		- did a couple more lesson. These were about downloading the course programs and setting them up.

Sunday 26/04/2020:
-----------------------
1. Have added the final boss scene to the level 3 data.
		- Still needs a lot of fixes with the wiring.
		- Also i havent done any of the items & conditions for this level at all.
		- While doing a bit of test play i noticed other problems and did some small issue fixes with previous level wiring.
		- Moving on to my homework.
		
2. HOMEWORK: Get the mini to work as intended.
		- I have only just remembered that i should have performed a git pull before starting my work.
		- hmmmm..... Maybe i can do the anal and inferior thing, and manually copy all of the changes from your last commit. 
		- So that when i perform my push i wont get a conflict. worth a try. if only to teach me why this sucks.
		- And then my desire to never have to do this again will fuel my need to learn how to do it with git.
		- Ok i believe i managed to manually recreate what you made. Now i willl do a commit.
		- Then i will actually work on my homework and do another commit.		
		- Ok that didnt work. My push was rejected. Contacting sensei.
		
2.1 ACTUAL HOMEWORK:
		- Recreate the smallest possible complex data structure that simulates the issues i encountered on level 3
		- Issues include: Revisiting a room, Transition name changed after visiting a state, Entering a scene with/without required items/journal entries, looping in/out complex conversations.
		- If the single structure becomes too complex or doesnt solve all issues, then create a second mini data set.
		- The purpose of this drill is to practice trouble shooting via ISOLATION and MINIMAL recreation of the problem. 
		
2.2 I did homework:
		- I made a data set that resembles the issue i had met.
		- I dont think i have managed to satisfy all of the parameters but i think we have something to work with. 
		- I will add on this further when im not harassed by surprise visitors.
		
3, Testing Automation course:
		- Will wait for tomorrow. Damn visitors.

Saturday 25/04/2020:
------------------------
1. Added the 1st scene of the final level.
		- States and transitions have been added.
		- Still need to place items and journal entries.
		- Also i need to place the whole final scene.

2. Starting my  testing automation course.
				- 1st 3 lessons completed. Those were just the overview.
				- Looks like this course will be using a free program called "Selenium". My google search claims this is a very poopular tool ith good credits. Thats what google says.

Friday 24/04/2020:
-------------------
1. Tried coming up with new features for the program.
	- Anything that i came up with i ended up discarding because none of it was essential for the program.
	- I think that at some point i "COULD" develope conditions for items:
		- This could be an addition to the current conditions system or an entirely new function.
		- It could be a function that receives a transition, checks for the existence of an item or a journal entry (also item i know).
		  Then depending on the result it will grant the player an item/journal entry from a list, or both.. i dont know.
		- Somehow i feel that this is already how the system works anyway. 
		- My assumption was to upgrade the 'PerformTransition' function. But after reading it i dont think that this is the right place.

2. I had a mental breakdown.
	- I has become doubt.
	- Recalibrated my brain.
	- CONCLUSION: 
			- DarkestDark has pretty much completed its functional requirements. I will not focus on developing anything new for it.
			- I will continue filling out the minimal data required in order to move on to the next phase.
			- NEXT PHASE: Use DarkestDark as a test subject in order to learn Test automation.
			- QUESTION: Correct me if im wrong but it seems that test automation is rather expensive. Does that mean that only large companies can afford it?
					- If so does that mean that my lack of official training (and older age) would be a sever detriment to my ability to get hired?
					- Are there even jobs for people like me in Israel?
					- Should i start looking for work online in other countries?
					- Will i be able to feed myself after my parents can no longer support me and the world descends into chaos?
					- Why is it that suicide is back on the list of legal transitions? :P
					- TOPKEK! Depressed humor is not funny! Use energy to improve self not hate self.
			
3. I have spent some time reading about test automation. Was not surprised to find that it is an entire field of study in itself with its	
	own methodologies, theories, programs, markets etc.
	- I will start some sort of online course to supplement sensei's teachings as sensei cannot be expected to teach me giant blocks of technical info.

4. REQUEST:
		- In these times of confusion. I would like to ask you for guidance. Is this indeed the time to transition away from learning general coding?
		- Am i again straying away from the correct path due to emotional imbalance? 
		- Career advise plox :( 
		
5. No more work for today. Most of my energy was spent in study and banter with self.
	- Thats ok though. Not all work results in lines of code.
	- Onwards to somesort of victory... some day... i hope...

Thursday 23/04/2020:
-------------------------
1. Placed journal entries on their corresponding transitions.
	- I have encountered an issue where the same transition could give 2 different journal entries when only one should be given based on a codition.
	- I need to think on how to extend the conditions system so it would fix this issue.
		- EXAMPLE: When the player finds ROBERTS HEAD, he should get a different journal entry depending or not if he has spoken to the ghoul about ROBERT.
		- My 1st guess is to go look at how the Conditions are currently working and then see how i extend the Items system to include the relevant code.
		- Its not very important at the moment since its not a must. But its nice to keep it in my head as an option.
		
2. Placing journal entry conditions on transitions. Got my work cut out for me. 

Wednesday 22/04/2020:
----------------------------
1. StateRunner.cs now has a new function called "BuildInventory". 
	- Its the same code copied from Repl.cs. Which now calls on this function in order to work the inventory.

Teusday 21/04/2020:
------------------------
1. All level 1 + 2 journal entries now exist in Journal Entries.json
	- I will do the flagging tomorrow. Have been sick most of the day.

Monday 20/04/2020:
------------------------
1. Spent the whole day with family. Holocaust eve brings people together... through ZOOM. crazy times.

Sunday 19/04/2020:
-----------------------
1. Added some items:
		- Now the grand hall on level 2 has doors that change name once you visit the rooms.
		- Inventory items have been placed all around the level
		- items.json has been updated with every new item.
		- All fight choices now cost items when chosen.
		- Tomorrow ill add journal entries and conditions. I expect that bug you mentioned to happen as soon as i set for more than 1 condition. Ill try and tackle it when it occurs. If i cant handle it ill contact you.
		- This is all coming out so nicely. Also i just realised while working on the data in the past few days that this sort of was my job in my last company. I did very little QA and a lot of data wiring. Only this time i like what im working on.
		

Saturday 18/04/2020:
-------------------------
1. Finished adding level 2 states and transitions.
	- Still nee to fill out the text for many of the states / transitions.
	- Tomorrow i will start flagging for items (visited rooms, inventory items & journal entries).
	- OMG! I'v been planning this project for so long and its now finally starting to take shape. Im excited. :D 

Friday 17/04/2020:
----------------------
1. Added more level 2 data:
	- Almost completed adding all states and transitions.
	- No items or journal entries made yet.
	- Shadow conversation needs more work.
	- Gargoyle fight needs more work.

Thursday 16/04/2020:
-------------------------
1. Started adding level 2 data.
	- Encountered a bug. Since the combat is simply choices. when choosing to use a weapon you get transitioned into the inventory but on the regular staterunner (not overlay).
	- I think this is because we made those item states + transitions that we ended up not using. I think i can remove them without issue, but ill get to it later.
	- So iv been at it for a few hours. Thats good enough for now. Gonna push.

Wednesday 15/04/2020:
----------------------------
1. Added some journal entries to the data.
2. Rewrote inventory with a foreach loop and it works!
3. Now lesson shall begin, more shall be done today. 
HOMEWORK:
4. Moral System: 
		- Map the 1st level for moral paths using the conditions + items system.
5. For now the MAP FEATURE is not relevant simply because its too needlessly complicated to make in a console app. 
6. Build level 2 using the current system.
WISDOM: If i get confused it means i probably havent read the code correctly.
7. did some code declattering

Teusday 14/04/2020:
------------------------
1. Make the journal print like the inventory:
	- Technically like you said i can sort of copy the printing protocol from inventory.
	- HOWEVER! Inventory is using Select() to access the string, int kvp.
	- Journal is a string, string (name + text). So i dont think i can use Select() for this. Ill see what i can do.
	- Commiting changes hoping master wll help
		- rewrite the journal code so it would be broken down to step by step using foreeach loops
		- Do the same for inventory

Thursday 09/04/2020:
-------------------------
1. Added Transition breakdown file - With Questions
2. Added StateRunner breakdown file
3. Added StatGraph breakdown file - With commentary
4. Wondering if i should start focusing on QA automation or keep on focusing on general programing. 


Wedneday 08/04/2020:
---------------------------
1. Added State breakdown file
2. SEDER PESAH ONLINE!!! 

Teusday 07/04/2020:
------------------------
Homework:
1. Break down the following classes:
	- State.cs
	- Transition.cs
	- StateRunner.cs
	- StateGraph.cs
	

Monday 06/04/2020:
------------------------
1. Sent sensei the code breakdown of Repl.cs

Sunday: 05/04/2020:
-----------------------
1. Tried to figure out the problem from yesterday.
2. Cried to master.
3. Got advice and broke down the code line by line in a seperate document.
	- Tried on paper. Made a mess,
	- Tried making a google doc flowchart. Made a mess.
	- Tried paper again. Made less of a mess. But i have found out what i dont get.
	PROBLEM: In Repl.cs: Perform transition() is too complicated for me. So many ifs and stuff. I cant figure out how the output of this
					   thing even looks. 
	QUESTION: How does the outout of this thing works? I get everything except for way "choice" is handled and returned from performtransition().
	
Saturday 04/04/2020:
------------------------
Darkest Dark:
1. Organised the states and transition into files for better project navigation.
2. Item states plan and proccess:
	- So i think i will make an Overlay Items file for overlay item states and a file for overlay item transitions.
	- This way i can make them without changing anything in the current items file. Lets see how this works out.
	- Already iv encountered issues. The "Inventory" state needs to contain transitions to all available items.
	- Also those transitions should only be printed if the item value == 0. So i need to set a condition. Lets hope this works.
	- Ok iv managed to make a working item state. Only "Issue" currently is that in order for it to be available comfortably, i need to make it belong to the inventory state.
	- So ill start with that and then we will fix the formatting later.
	- Ok soooo..... Good news it works.
	- Bad news its a fucking mess. Shit is getting multi printed even when not wanted.
	- There are too many systems working simultaniously. I cant get my head around it right now. But im digging this.
	- I had to get through a bunch of bugs to get this to work but all in all it wasn't impossible.
	- So iv reviewed the Repl.cs and i think that in order to get things printed correctly i will need:
			- Steal the printing protocol for the regular states and their transitions and put it into the overlay.
			- Make it so that each item get a number printed before it just like the regular transitions.
			- Make it so that when inventory is open then regular transitions are not accessible (to prevent a number meaning 2 different transitions "regular/overlay")
			- I think there wont be a need anymore for the kvp thingy that prints the item text in the inventory since thats what the item state is for.
			- Ill be honest, im scared of messing around with Reple.cs on this level since i dont really know whta im doing. ould be happy to get a review for my plan before i go fiddling around.
			- When all of this is working i will pretty much copy paste it for the journal since the functionality is almost identical.

Friday 03/04/2020:
---------------------
1. Reviewed the 2 commits that sensei made.
	- Checked line by line and followed the functionality.
	- Those are a lot of tweaks, but im glad i was in the right direction.
	- Lel "w" != "W" :P
	- some marked code pieces (on github) are actually unchanged. Did you erase and remake them?
	- I saw that you removed a white space on Reple.cs line 27. I thought that C# is not white space sensitive. Or is it just for cleaner looking code?
	- I see that making the List<Recipe> takes the required functionality from the stategraph.cs. It only really nees to hold the data itself ithout further stuff.
	- And yes now the LoadRecipes function works as intended. So smooth, so clean. 
	
2. Ill take on the journal and item sates tomorrow. 

Thursday 02/04/2020:
-------------------------
Factorio.Mess:
1. Made my attempt at making the  static function for Recipe.cs. 
	- Broke down the code step by step.
	- Used Json reading functions from StateGraph.cs as reference for my code.
	- Encountered bugs that i couldn't resolve. (Please check Factorio.Mess Recipe.cs)
	
 Darkest Dark:
1. Created some fluf text for the existing items in the inventory.
	- There is a bug. While opening the inventory all texts for items are printed next to them. Except for "Holy Water" which gets no text printed. 
	   I cant tell why though. No error is mentioned and the code isnt different for this perticular item.
	- How do i make a state for each item? Or more accurately, WHERE do i put those ItemStates? Do i make a new file? do i put them in States.Json? does it matter?
	- Do i need to make any updates to the machine in order for this to work or can i simply use it as is?

2. Added a couple of journal items.
	- How do i make it so that the journal will be printed like the inventory? Shouldi just copy the code? 
	   
3. did a tiny bit of formatting on how things are printed.
WISDOM:
------------
Remember wisdom for life. Whenever you try to make anything in code, try to think what would be the most minimal way that it could be represented in code
and then work from there. Add any missing pieces in order to most accurately represent the thing that you want to do. WISDOM

Wednesday 01/04/2020:
----------------------------
HW for Thursday. Give success or questions. Like Readstategraph but readrecipes[].
1. Write a static function for Recipe.cs that receives a path to a file and returns a list of recipes.
2. Fill up the DarkestDark data that is missing. 

ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wednesday 24/03/2020:
-----------------------------
HW leftovers:
1. Practice where() and select()
2. Verify journal functionality and keep developing.
3. We talked about recursion
4. Figure out how nathan built the journal and apply it in the game via new data.
5. Use the same conditions + items structure to develope the next feature (Moral progress).
6. When pulling the git from nathan, stash my own files if needed, then pull, then "pop" the stash. Might get conflict.
7. We now have a state machine in Factorio.Mess
8. Organize the DarkestDark states and transitions into orderly files. 
9. DD: Develope text for items (The same can be done for journal items):
		- 1. State Per Item
		- 2. Transition to Item per Item
			- 2.1 Condition: Have Item
		- 3. Transition to Inventory (from item)

Teusday 24/03/2020:
------------------------
1. DarkestDark: I want to make it so that when an item is used, its kvp value goes down by 1 int.
	- So i think i need to set a condition that if transition requires an item, when that transition is chosen it makes the value of the item go down by 1
	- Now to locate where that thing happens in the code.
	- Turns out it was alreay implemented and i just had to learn it.
2. Made a journal state. It works exactly like the inventory. Ill make a tweaked version of the items being added for the journal entries.
3. Factorio.Mess: Added the furnace and its required supplements. It should work now but i cant test it since im faultering with the else if bullshit to get it done in game.
	
Monday 23/03/2020:
-------------------------
1. Organize the factorio.mess project to files - DONE
2. New DarkestDark inventory fixes work great. Next thing is making it so that /// items.kvp.value -1 /// when used.
3. Reviewed time related code on factorio.mess, have yet to implement the MinedSoFar() function.
4. Reviewed the Exercise program.cs file. Was able to read it and sort of understand it in general. But the mechanical operations are still very confusing. Ill have to work on it more to get anywhere.
5. Journal will have to wait. Simply because FUCK.
6. Furnace will have to wait because FUCK.
7. GAME OF LIFE can be removed from this list until more FUCKs have been delivered from Spain.
8. Writing a calculator seems like an awesome little project that absolutely should do. Soon. But it is not this day.
9. Read about recusion functions in C#. Had to also learn about factorials since i have never heard of them before. Now i know why there was a ! buttom on my school calculator. 


Wednesday 18/03/2020:
-----------------------------
HOMEWORK:
1. Practice "Where()" by reading about arrays and lists in C# and trying different IEnumerables
2. "Select()" is like where but instead of filtering members, it changes their data type and makes a new list containing the new members
3. Apply some inventory usage to verify functionality.
4. Develope Journal feature.
5. Factorio mess: Go over the time settings.
6. Check Program.cs and follow instructions.
7. Develope Furnace.
8. Organize the project to files.
9. Take another look at GAME OF LIFE. 
10. Try writing a console calculator (TIP: Make the calculator in prefix notation "+ 1213423")
11. READ ABOUT RECURION FUNCTION 

Teusday 17/03/2020:
------------------------
1. Reviewed new code and notes.
2. Fine i wont be messing with time.
3. Im setting a loop counter for the factorio.mess so i could keep track of the number of loops in each run (Instead of timer).
4. Currently there is a bug with the 3rd option (View Resources). when you choose to mine for coal it adds 1 coal AND 1 iron. Ill try to fix that.
5. Nope that wasnt the issue... Im just not printing the right stuff. I need to get the 3rd option to acutally print the number of each resource... hmmm....
6. I tried 6 different things. Couldnt none of them to work:
	- I tried making an inventory class that holds the current number of each resource. But i couldnt get it to work.
	- I tried doign something similar with a function but had syntax / context issues.
	- I tried playing with the CW output but couldnt get it to print what i want.
	- I tried to overhaul the class structure so that resources.... nvm i dont know what i was trying to do there... Just a mess. UNDO!
	- I tried writing a resource printer function that just keeps track of the contents of the resources dictionary and prints them. Failed again.
	- I tried changing the return from the MineCoal() + MineIron() functions so that instead of returning a new resource, it would add +1 to the value of that resource in the resources dictionary. Coudnt get it to work. BAH!

7. moving back to DarkestDark. Need to make the inventory there work properly...
8. Ok. I think i got it. Now it prints what i want.
9. Just need to remove the stuff that is no longer necessary, but ill wait for our meeting before i remove stuff.
10. Im really happy, it took way more thinking and proding to figure out the simple answer 
Sunday 15/03/2020:
-----------------------
1. Working on FactorioMess project because im stuck on the main one.
2. I want to implement a timer in the game so that drills will make resources every fe seconds.
3. Spent 2 hours trying to follow tutorials on how to use timers in c#. 
4. None of the tutorials i followed actually orked. Their code isnt working on my machine and i dont know why? Versions maybe?
5. I also tried implementing a 3rd option that prints out the reasources. But it only prints out the number of resource types and not the number of resources contained.
6. Hlp plox.

Wednesday 11/03/2020:
----------------------------
1. Pulled the last commit and reviewed.
2. Located all the pieces involved with the inventory.
3. Played around until i got more familiar.
4. I thought i had a plan but when i fired it up nothing happened. Nothing broke but nothing changed.
5. On Repl.cs : I tried using a double IF loop to set conditions for the CurrentOverlayState to trigger and print the Inventory text.
6. If that would have succeeded i would then advance to making it print CurrentOverlayState.Items
7. But try as i might i couldnt get it to work.   

SOME MORE TIME PASSED

Teusday 02/03/2020:
------------------------
1. Restored the daily report file.
2. Opened a new file for the overlay
3. Put down the groundwork for the overlay.
4. I think im in the right direction but im not there yet. Assistence required.
5. Factorio.mess has been fucked with. There is a bug now and my debugging came out empty. halp plox.

Sunday 16/02/2020:
-----------------------
1. Factorio late game is annoying but im getting the hang of it. Need to clear many bugs away from uranium ore so i can go nuclear.
2. Applied the fix you showed me to the code. Added another json file for the closet room.
3. I tried setting a condition on the "Search the closet" transition so it would only appear when item "Key" = 0. But it didnt work. I reverted it to avoid bugs.
4. Git push!
5. Its time i started digging into lambda multiplication.

Saturday 15/02/2020:
