# Notes

1. Deleted some code that was problematic.
	1. Review the changes and the code that's left.
	2. Try to figure out wtf.
2. Remember about F5 Debugging and F9 Breakpoints? Try using them.
3. Oh Timers, forget about timers for now. 
	1. Since we're working in a CLI (Command Line Interface) evnironment, think of every loop of the REPL as a Tick of Time.
	2. I'll tell you more about time when we meet.
4. Where you're trying to print the resources:
	1. `resources` is the dictionary instance.
	2. `resources.Values` is a collection of all of the values in dictionary.
	3. `.Count` gives you the number of items in a collection.
